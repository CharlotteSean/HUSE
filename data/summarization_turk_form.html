<p>For each question, you are given a randomly sampled <b>news article and its headline</b>. Please categorize the comment into one of five buckets based on <strong>how typical it is as a&nbsp;summary headline</strong>. Typicality is a measure of <strong>how often you would see an exact sentence in the corpus</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>In addition, typical news article headlines tend to be grammatical, factual (no added facts / people or omitted major facts).</strong></p>

<p>We have retained the real headlines&nbsp;+ added control questions and will reject your submission if you are too far off from the ground truth.</p>

<p>Note: Longer sentences are rarer than you might otherwise expect.&nbsp;Some sentences have had proper nouns and numbers removed and replaced by "####" and/or <strong>UNKNOWN</strong><unk>&nbsp;tokens. <strong>Do not penalize for any of these features.</strong></unk></p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF BUCKETS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Very Typical:</strong>&nbsp;You expect to see this all the time.</p>

<p><strong>Typical: </strong>You often expect&nbsp;to see something&nbsp;like this.</p>

<p><strong>Average:&nbsp;</strong>Not surprised to see this, but would not appear as often as a typical comment.</p>

<p><strong>Specific: </strong>This is a correct response, but only in a very specific setting.</p>

<p><strong>Rare: </strong>This is some context where this is a correct response, but you would be surprised to see it.</p>

<p><strong>Invalid</strong>: Not a valid&nbsp;headline. Contains some clearly wrong facts or is grammatically incorrect.​</p>
